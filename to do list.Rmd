## To Do List

#### Misc

- name of link has the <br>

#### Formatting   

- copy mock_solana template for blog posts (if I want different color like in welcome.rmd)

#### Content

- add resume link?
- it's published -> would need to keep updating as I'm making small fixes
  - maybe get a domain at some point?
